        highlights:
          - I have worked on the HyperAST project with the DIVERSE research team. This tool in development aims at analyzing git history in a more efficient way. For each commit we get an AST, the HyperAST takes the time into account to store a complete image of a complete git history that can be searched faster than any other state-of-the-art method.
